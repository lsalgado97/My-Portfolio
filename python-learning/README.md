# python-learning
This folder contains code I wrote while learning (and I still am!) Python. As of now, it is divided into 2 folders:

- [**basics**](basics): In here, you will find simple games coded in Python, made to showcase the basics of Python.

- [**OO**](OO): In here, you will find codes in which I construct classes and objects in Python. They are meant to showcase the principles of object oriented programming with the language.
