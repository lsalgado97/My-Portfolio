# My-Portfolio
Currently, I'm learning Python and data science techniques so that I may start a carreer in that field. This is a personal portfolio so that I can keep track of my codes and learning curve. It is currently divided in the following folder(s):

- [**python-learning**](python-learning): In here you can find some code I wrote while taking python learning courses. It features the basics of python and also object orientation programming in the language. All code was written in the JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition 2019.2 IDE, which can also be used to run the programs.

Soon, I intend to add new folders with small projects in data science and machine learning. And maybe some other interesting stuff I write around the way :)

Also, this repository has no license. However, you may download or copy the files with the sole purpose of testing them and understand what my codes do. If you are learning Python like me, I hope my codes encourage and inspire you to learn more of this magic language! :D
