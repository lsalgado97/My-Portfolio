# My-Portfolio
This is a personal portfolio containing some code I wish to showcase for professional purposes. It is intended to show recruiters some code I wrote and small projects I am writing. It is currently divided in the following folder(s):

- [**python-learning**](python-learning): In here are some code I wrote while taking python learning courses. It features the basics of python and also object orientation programming in the language. All code was written in JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition 2019.2 IDE, which can also be used to run the program.

Soon, I intend to add new folders with small projects in Data Science and Machine Learning. And maybe some other interesting stuff I write around the way :)
